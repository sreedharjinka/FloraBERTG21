Been looking for the datasets nad found three websites which offer gene links which are required for the project
1.https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/ensemblgenomes/pub/
2.https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/
3.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/?term=Bos+taurus

Explored at the above directories for data sequences and made a separate csv for gene_link, annot_link, fasta_link.
